<h3>2.4.2 Interactive Code Lesson</h3>
<p>
An interactive code lesson is a lesson that combines instructional text with
code examples.  The code examples may be modifiable and executable. 
</p>
<p>
The student can use the scroll bar on the right hand side of the page to 
navigate within the lesson.  At the end of the lesson, select "next"
or "previous" to move to the next or previous lesson.
</p>

<h4>2.4.2.1 Editable / Executable Code</h4>

<p>
Interactive Code Lessons may include editable or executable code.  
</p>
<p>
Editable code will be contained in a text box.  Students type code into the box 
use it like a standard GUI text editor (like gedit or notepad).
</p>
<p>
The sample code may also be executable.  In this case, the student presses the
"run" button and the code in the box runs.  Output from the program is
displayed below the code.  
</p>
<p>
The figure below demonstrates how a lesson might use editable code to teach
about initializing arrays.
</p>

</p>
<hr />

<p>
Here, the lesson explicitly asks the student to edit the code and fix a 
problem.  The student selects "run" and realizes that all of the baskets
contain nothing.  He adds a single line and selects run again, this time
the baskets contain items.

<p>
The shell is not restricted to code specified by examples, giving the student
freedom to experiment within the confines of the code language.
</p>

<h3>2.4.3 Quizzes</h3>

<p>
Quiz lessons give the student immediate feedback on their understanding of 
lesson material.  A quiz consists of one or more questions that should be 
answered by the student.
</p>

</p>
<hr />

<p>
The student answers the mutliple choice questions by clicking on of the
radio buttons next to the answer of his choice.  The answer can be changed
as many times as the student wants.  Once the student finishes the quiz, he
selects the "submit" button to receive his score.

<p>
After the student completes the quiz, they will be presented with the results.
In this example, you are able to see which questions you got wrong, and 
what the right answer was.
