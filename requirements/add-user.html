2.3.4.1 Adding a User to the Class Roster
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This scenario shows how the instructor of a class can add users to the class roster. 
Adding users is important because it allows the instructor to put students into a class for stat tracking and allows students to view the lessons in the class. The instructor can also set permissions to allow a teacher's assistant to help manage the class. 
In this scenario, we assume that the instructor has just logged into the appropriate class and is looking at the instructor page. 
Details of logging in as an instructor can be found in 
<a href="login-screen.html">
Section 2.1.

<p>
To add a user to the class roster, the instructor clicks <tt>Add User</tt> button on the roster screen and the diaglog box shown in Figure 2.3.4.1-1 is shown by the system.

The user field is a one line string where a person's user name is typed in. After the user name is entered, click <tt>Add</tt> to add the user to the class roster.
