1.5.1.  VimTutor
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Vimtutor is a great first step to learning vim.  It walks the user through
the basics of the editor, including a couple of "wow, cool!" features to
show how vim can improve productivity.  At it's core, it's simply a text file,
which is the environment where vim's features are strongest.  Because the 
tutor is just a text file that you edit with vim, the system employs a "learn
by doing" approach that drops you right into vim.
<p>
<strong>Good Features:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
"Learn by Doing" approach.  You have to learn the first few lessons just to
get to the next one.
<li>
Shows off most useful features without bogging down in complex advanced topics
<li>
Exceptionally clear instructions. Effort to be concise and clear is evident.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bad Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Learning curve is high.  Not everyone will want to finish.
<li>
Not very flashy. ASCII text file only.
<li>
Installed with VIM, only contains a small set of lessons. Only extendable by
editing the file locally or submitting a patch to the maintainer.
<li>
Additional "lessons" involve reading manpages or static documentation. No further
interactive lessons.
<li>
"Retaking" lessons involves hitting the "undo" command multiple times, or 
restarting the entire lesson process.
<li>
All lessons on same page.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Missing Features:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Ability to add new lessons
</ul>
