<p>
The "Create Class" button is only visible to instructors.
<br>
<br>
Classes are how lessons are grouped together for an insructor to manage.  
A class is always the top folder in a directory, and anything within the class
is a lesson or quiz. 
<br>
For an instructor to add a new class, he or she clicks on the "Create Class" button
located in the Navigation bar. CSTutor displays the screen in Figure 2.3.1-1 and once 
completed, a new class is created.

"Class Name" takes in the name of the class from the instructor and the "Private" 
checkbox gives power to the instructor to only allow certain student users to 
access the class lessons.
Once the instructor has entered the class name, they can submit their class.

Once submitted, CSTutor shows the instructor a page edit screen of the main 
page of the class(More information can be found 
 on the <a href="edit-lesson.html">Editing Lessons</a> Page).  The 
class is also added to their navigation bar and the instructor is then 
able to create lessons for that class.
